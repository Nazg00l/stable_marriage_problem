# STABLE MARIAGE PROBLEM

This problem is used to match same size of 2 lists consist of different objects. In this implementation i used Gale & 
Shapley's "Deferred Acceptance Procedure" and developed in PHP language.

This implementation works in console, has a input generator up to 100 couples but you can add more same size of men and 
women easily into input_generator.php if you want.

## Increasing men and women number
Open input_generator.php and you will see men and woman array list and you can add same size of men and women to the 
two lists
